        I'm a passionate front-end developer with a strong foundation in modern
        web technologies.
        <br />
        I've built several projects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and
        specialize in creating dynamic, responsive interfaces with ReactJS,
        Redux, and TypeScript.
        <br />
        <br />
        My experience includes working with tools like React Query for efficient
        data fetching and YUP for robust form validation.
        <br />
        On the design side, I enjoy crafting clean and intuitive user interfaces
        using Tailwind CSS, and Chakra UI.
        <br />
        <br />
        I'm constantly learning and love turning ideas into real, user-friendly
        applications.
        <br />
        Whether I'm collaborating on a team or working independently, I aim to
        write scalable, maintainable code and deliver polished user experiences.
